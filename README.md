# ChatGPT Integration with NodeJs(Backend)

This is the backend code that I wrote for a GPT-Based Content Creation Tool Project which was being created using the OpenAI API Key with NodeJs and ExpressJs in the backend. The Project works well, however before some of the issues with the integration of the API key calling model "text-davinci-002" could be solved, the API key expired. I am currently exploring other open-source alternatives such as OpenChatKit, for integration into this project.

## Project Status --> Paused!!!
